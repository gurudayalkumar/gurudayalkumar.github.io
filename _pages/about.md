**Welcome to my personal website!**

I am an **applied environmental economist** with main focus on **socio-economic impacts of climate change**.

I am a 3rd year PhD Candidate in Economics at the [Indian Institute of Technology Indore.](https://www.iiti.ac.in/)

My current research relates to the **climate change and vulnerability** particularly in developing economies. Applying the IPCC framework and applied machine learning, I study: 

(1) Flood vulnerability index: **an intergrated socioeconomic and environmental approach**; 
(2) **Rainfall and flood impact** prediction. 

I am also studying the relationship between **socio-economic outcomes and flood exposure**.
