**Welcome to my personal website!**


I am an **applied environmental economist** with main focus on **economics of climate change and migration**.


I am a 3rd year PhD Candidate in Economics at the [Indian Institute of Technology Indore.](https://www.iiti.ac.in/)


My current research relates to the **climate change and vulnerability** particularly in developing economies. I study: 

(1) Flood vulnerability index: **an intergrated socioeconomic and environmental approach**; 

(2) **Rainfall and flood impact** prediction. 


I am also studying the relationship between **socio-economic outcomes and flood exposure** from the policy perspectives.
